This explainer is meant to show you how the `Async Transform` Vite plugin works so that you can be
confident in using it. If you want to know how to setup the Vite plugin please go to the following

## What's a Vite plugin

For those who doesn't know anything about what a Vite plugin even is and want to know more here's a
little explainer in the explainer. If you just want to know about what the `Async Transform` does
feel free to skip to the next paragraph.

<details>
	<summary>Explainer in the explainer</summary>

    A Vite plugin is essentially a small bit of code with a series of methods that Vite will call
    sequentially during the dev and build script.

    Every function is called in a specific moment of the build and can affect it in different ways.

    Here's an example of a very simple Vite plugin very similar to one in <BlankLink href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/api-plugin" body="their documentation" />

    <Code lang="ts" code={`

export const simpleTransform = {
	// name is used during debug
	name: 'simple-transform',
	transform(src, fileName){
		// we only handle our custom file extension
		if(fileName.endsWith('.myext')){
			return {
				// we transform the text in our file
				// to JS
				code: myExtToJs(src),
				// if possible return a sourcemap to allow for better debugging
				map: null,
			}
		}
	}
};
`}/>

In this case we were handling our own custom file extension and compile that to JS but you can also
use the transform hook to change your JS.

    <Code lang="ts" code={`

export const simpleTransform = {
	// name is used during debug
	name: 'remove-console-logs',
	transform(src){
		return {
			code: src.replaceAll(/console.log\(.+?\)/g, ""),
			map: null,
		}
	}
};
`}/>

This super simple plugin eliminate every instance of `console.log()` from your code.

<Aside type="caution">
	Don't use this anywhere it's just a silly example and you should probably be a bit more nuanced
	than `replaceAll` if you want to remove logs from your code.
</Aside>

The gist of it is: you can do a lot of cool things with a Vite plugin and we decided to build the
Async Transform to make your life (hopefully) easier!

## How the `Async Transform` changes my code?

The reason why we are writing this explainer is because we firmly believe that if you allow you code
to be changes by some script you should fully understand how it changes it and what the final result
will look like.

As shown in our [Mid run cancellation](/explainers/mid-run-cancellation) explainer this Vite plugin
aim to solve a couple of problems with async code in Typescript:

- Promises are non cancellable: once you start them there's no way to stop the code in the middle of
  the function from executing
- Generators can be "stopped" mid execution but Typescript doesn't play very well with the `yield`
  keyword

To fix this problems we let you write the simple and familiar async code and we provide a Vite
plugin to transform your async functions into generators!

<TabItem label="Before">

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { task } from '@sheepdog/svelte';

	const myTask = task(async () => {
		const result = await fetch('/api/my-endpoint');
		return await result.json();
	});
</script>

<button
	on:click={() => {
		myTask.perform();
	}}
>
	perform
</button>
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="After">

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { task } from '@sheepdog/svelte';

	const myTask = task(async function* () {
		const result = yield fetch('/api/my-endpoint');
		return yield result.json();
	});
</script>

<button
	on:click={() => {
		myTask.perform();
	}}
>
	perform
</button>
```

</TabItem>

As you can see we aim to touch your code the bare minimum. But I can still see the worry on your
face so let's dive a bit more and let's make a couple of clarifications

### What about my other async functions?

You don't want to see all of your beloved async functions be turned into generators right? Well,
worry not because we specifically target only the async functions that are arguments of our own
`task` or `task.modifier` functions. And we were really careful with this so even if you have other
functions that are named task or if you rename your import everything outside the argument of that
function will be left untouched.

```svelte {"This will remain untouched": 7-10} {"This will still be transformed": 12-16}
<script lang="ts">
	import { task as sheepdogTask } from '@sheepdog/svelte';

	function task(fn: () => Promise<any>) {
		// your code
	}

	const otherTask = task(async () => {
		// some async stuff
	});


	const myTask = sheepdogTask(async () => {
		const result = await fetch('/api/my-endpoint');
		return await result.json();
	});
</script>
```

<TabItem label="After">

		const result = yield fetch('/api/my-endpoint');
		return yield result.json();

and the same works even for imported functions with the same name.
